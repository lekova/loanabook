# LOAN-A-BOOK FRONTEND

Loan-a-Book is an app that allow users to share their books and keep track of all the books they have loaned or borrowed. As a catalog, the app allows visitors to browse all available books before they decide to create an account. Once logged in an user is able to see the location of other users and their contact information so he/she can request to loan a book. Users can review the collection of their book, the books they have loaned to other users and the books they have borrowed from other users. Users receive notifications when a book return is due.
